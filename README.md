TL;DR: why not?

I'm a Linux enthusiast, and I tried creating something that will allow 'normal' people to have a glimpse at my world.

## Quick Start


### Using npm/yarn

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
npm build
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```
